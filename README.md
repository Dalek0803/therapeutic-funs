# ğŸ§  Therapeutic Funsâ„¢  
**aka my brain is offline and this is cheaper than therapy**

Welcome to the repo where logic goes to die and sparkles are mandatory.  
This is where I dump my chaotic HTML/CSS/JS experiments when life is too much  
and GitHub is the only one who listens.

## ğŸš¨ What to expect:
- Buttons that may or may not do anything (but look slay)
- Compliment bots that gas you up better than your friends
- Hacker vibes, minus the actual hacking
- JavaScript that's 90% vibes, 10% syntax
- CSS crimes that somehow work
- Absolutely zero consistency

Nothing here is useful.  
Everything here is âœ¨emotional support codeâœ¨.

Feel free to clone, fork, laugh, or scream. Just donâ€™t ask for documentation.
