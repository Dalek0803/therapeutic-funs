# brain-offline.html ðŸ§ ðŸ’¤

A therapeutic HTML/CSS project made in the middle of a hyperfixation spiral.  
Built to visually express the feeling of being absolutely cooked, mentally checked out, and vibing with zero thoughts.

## What is this?

It's literally just a static HTML page that says **"brain offline"** and looks cute while doing it. No JavaScript, no interactivity â€” just âœ¨pure existential aestheticâœ¨.

## Why?

Because sometimes you just need to create something, even if itâ€™s silly.  
Also because crying is temporary, but HTML is forever.

Made by a very tired DevOps girlie - me, a.k.a. Dalek - who just wanted to feel something at work.
